SUMMARY:The Secrets of React's Virtual DOM
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Pete Hunt (Facebook / Instagram). At Facebook a
 nd Instagram, we’re trying to push the limits of what’s possible on the 
 web with React. My talk will start with a brief introduction to React an
 d then dive into three controversial topics: Throwing out the notion of 
 templates and building views with JavaScript, “re-rendering” your entire
  application when your data changes, and a lightweight implementation of
  the DOM and events.

SUMMARY:Meteor: A Full-stack JavaScript Framework for Modern App Develop
 ment
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Matt DeBergalis (Meteor). Meteor is a distribut
 ion of open-source packages that makes it radically faster to build mode
 rn apps. All the parts are there: a reactive template engine, powerful d
 ata synchronization primitives, a standard wire protocol, and a database
  API that works the same on both the client and the server. This talk wi
 ll demonstrate making an app from scratch, showing how it all fits toget

SUMMARY:Asynchronous Promises
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kris Kowal (MontageJS). A promise is a proxy fo
 r an eventual result, like an asynchronous version of return or throw, b
 ut they can also pipeline messages asynchronously to and from remote obj
 ects. A Promise type will likely be in ECMAScript 6, and many modern lib
 raries use them already. In this talk, I will bring you up to speed with
  what they are and what you can do with them today…and what they “promis
 e” for tomorrow.

SUMMARY:Design Strategies for JavaScript API
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ariya Hidayat (Shape Security). The quality of 
 modular web applications can be improved by having the right set of APIs
 . This talk highlights the recent API design best practices, from using 
 static polymorphism for consistent naming, preventing dangerous convenie
 nce (e.g. Boolean trap), and avoiding unreadable code due to confusing s
 emantics. Real-world examples and automated tools to recognize bad API w
 ill be shown as well.

 frustrating, but it doesn’t have to be. Open source accessibility testin
 g tools can help you find issues in a timely and useful way.  Accessibil
 ity Developer Tools is a JavaScript library for automated accessibility 
 testing of the DOM. We'll discuss how it works, and how it makes it easi

SUMMARY:Everything is a Polyfill: Automate Deleting Code for Front End P

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Rachel Myers (GitHub), Emily Nakashima (GitHub)
 . Successful applications often get slow because they include *all the c
 ode* - even if it isn't needed for a particular client or in the given c
 ircumstances. Embracing module loading tools (like Require.js) creates s
 maller, faster, cleaner applications. We'll talk about how to extend thi
 s paradigm to all the components of our app for better performance and m
 aintainability.

SUMMARY:Unpacking Technical Decisions
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Sarah Mei (Ministry of Velocity). Every day, we
  make hundreds of small technical decisions: what's the best way to impl
 ement this? Where should this function live? Less often, we make a large
 r decision: would a different framework make us more productive? Should 
 we rewrite the whole thing in C? We'd all like to make better decisions,
  at all of these scales. Let's unpack the decision-making process and se
 e what we can extract.
